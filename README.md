Currently, the only data included is for the Boston Police Department, and is based on
[this blog post](https://blogs.n1zyy.com/n1zyy/tutorials/boston-police-codes/).

If you'd like to see support added for your area, please create an Issue with a link to
any relevant data. Or, if you feel comfortable doing so, fork the repo and make a
Pull Request with a `JSON` file containing the relevant data.

If you have any questions or problems using the interface, please create an Issue with
